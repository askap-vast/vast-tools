This repository holds the code of the VAST Tools, a Python module to interact with results from the VAST Pipeline and the VAST Pilot Survey data.

Please read the [Installation Instructions](https://vast-survey.org/vast-tools/getting_started/installation/). If you have any questions or feedback, we welcome you to open an [issue](https://github.com/askap-vast/vast-tools/issues). 
If you are interested in contributing to the code, please refer to the [Contributing and Developing](https://vast-survey.org/vast-tools/contributing/develop/) section in the documentation.

## Features

  * The ability to interactively explore results from the VAST Pipeline, which includes:
      - Viewing light curves and postage stamps.
      - Performing transient analysis.
      - Crossmatching to external surveys.
      - Allowing for custom analyses to be easily performed.
  * Explore the VAST Pilot Survey footprints and check source coverage.
  * Query the VAST Pilot Survey data directly.
  * Perform forced extractions in the Pilot Survey data.
  * Search for the Sun, Moon and planets in the data, including pipeline outputs.
  * Notebook friendly package.
  

_Note that some features require access to the VAST Pilot Survey data._
