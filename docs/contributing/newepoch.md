# Adding a New Epoch

VAST Tools contains packaged observing information and MOC files for each epoch of the VAST Pilot Survey that is available.
When a new epoch is ready to be added to VAST Tools the following must be completed.

## Future Epochs Warning

!!! warning 
    This package provides complete access to Phase I of the VAST Pilot Survey, which has been conducted at a single frequency.
    As such,  the individual tile observations from which the epochs were constructed were standardised and had the same footprint.
    For example, the field `VAST_0216-06A` had the same footprint in every epoch.
    Some epochs of the Phase II survey will be carried out at a higher frequency and hence, will have different footprints and field centres. The current version of the package *cannot* be used to access these observations.
    To handle this, VAST Tools must be updated to:
      
      * Be able to determine which footprint of the tile is requried if the tiles have the same central name and pointing at a different frequency.
      * Update the `vasttools/data/mocs/COMBINED` and `vasttools/data/mocs/TILES` with MOCS of the new footprints.
      * Add new 'field' MOC files in `vasttools/data/mocs/` to provide new VAST Pilot Survey defined fields if necessary.
      * Update the file `vasttools/data/csv/vast_field_centres.csv` if required.
      
    In addition, users should be aware that the `max_sep` parameter in the [`Query`](../../components/query) component may need tweaking.

## Generating the VAST Tools metadata

### Epoch information csv files

These files contain the observing information of each individual beam that makes up the epoch
The example below shows the expected format.

!!! example "vast_epoch09_info.csv"
    ```text

    ```
    The description of these columns can be found [here](../../components/survey/#fields-attributes).

These files use data from the [`ASKAP_SURVEYS`](https://bitbucket.csiro.au/projects/ASKAP_SURVEYS/repos/vast/browse){:target="_blank"} repository. These files can be automatically generated by pointing [`vasttools.tools.create_fields_csv`](../../reference/tools/#vasttools.tools.create_fields_csv) to a local version of `ASKAP_SURVEYS`. See the function documentation for details.

### MOCs and STMOCs

Information about the survey coverage is stored as multi-order coverage maps (MOCs) and space-time MOCs (STMOCs) in the `vasttools/data/mocs/` direcory. The [`vasttools.tools.gen_mocs_epoch`](../../reference/tools/#vasttools.tools.gen_mocs_epoch) function can be used to generate all MOC data for a single epoch. This function will generate an individual MOC for each pointing, a MOC containing the combined footprint of all pointings in the epoch, and an updated STMOC describing the coverage of the full survey to-date. Currently only the latter two are required to add a new epoch to the package, as individual field footprints do not vary from epoch to epoch and are stored in `vasttools/data/mocs/COMBINED` and `vasttools/data/mocs/TILES`.

However, adding observations with different footprints (e.g. the Phase II survey high frequency observations) will require new footprint MOCs to be created. This will also require new field MOCs (e.g. `vasttools/data/mocs/VAST_PILOT_FIELD_1.fits`) to be generated, although no automated process for this exists yet.

## Epoch Addition Steps
1. Generate the epoch metadata using the methods described above.

2. Place the epoch information csv file in `vasttools/data/csvs/`, named `vast_epochXX_info.csv`, where `XX` is the two digit zero padded epoch number.

3. Place the full-epoch MOC in `vasttools/data/mocs/`, named `VAST_PILOT_EPOCHXX.moc.fits`, where `XX` is the two digit zero padded epoch number.

4. Replace the current version of `VAST_PILOT.stmoc.fits` in `vasttools/data/mocs/` with the updated version containing the observations from the new epoch.

3. Add the new epoch to the `RELEASED_EPOCHS` variable found in [`vasttools.survey`](../../reference/survey).

4. Add the new epoch to the `FIELD_FILES` variable found in [`vasttools.survey`](../../reference/survey).

5. Make sure the new epoch data is present in the standard release format if the instance of VAST Tools has access to the survey data.
