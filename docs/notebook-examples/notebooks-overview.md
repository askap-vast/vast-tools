# VAST Tools Example Notebooks

This section provides example Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate how to use the various features and components that VAST Tools offer.

!!! tip
    Users may prefer the more traditional Jupyter Notebook format rendering by viewing them directly in the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/askap-vast/vast-tools/tree/master/notebook-examples){:target="_blank"}.
    They can also be easily downloaded from this location.

The available notebooks are:

* [Catalogue Crossmatch](catalogue-crossmatching-example.ipynb)  
    Provides an example of how to match an external catalogue to a VAST Pipeline run or a VAST Tools Query.

* [Planet Searching](planet-hunting-example.ipynb)  
    Provides an example of how to check for planets in a pipeline run or in the VAST Pilot Survey using a VAST Tools Query.

* [Query Source Search](source-search-example.ipynb)  
    Provides an example of how to use a VAST Tools Query to search for a source.
    Note that it is now preferable to search for a source in the pipeline run of the VAST Pilot Survey data.
    
* [Using VAST MOCs](using-vast-mocs-example.ipynb)  
    Provides an example of how to use the MOC files of the VAST Pilot Survey that are packaged with VAST Tools.
    
* [VAST Pipeline Exploration](vast-pipeline-example.ipynb)  
    Provides an example of how to interact with a run from the VAST Pipeline.

* [VAST Workshop 2023 notebook](workshop-notebook-2023.ipynb)  
    This notebook was used in the VAST software tutorial at the 2023 VAST Workshops. It provides an overview of the most common use cases, synthesising aspects of most of the above notebooks.

!!! warning "Warning: Example Parameters"
    Remember that while the parameters and thresholds used in the example notebooks may provide a good starting point, they may not be best suited to your own science goals.
