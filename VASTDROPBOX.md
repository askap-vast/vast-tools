# get\_vast\_pilot\_dbx.py

This script allows for simple downloading of the VAST Pilot survey from Dropbox.

Features:
* Generate a list of available files.
* State which Epochs are available.
* Download an entire Epoch.
* Download user requested files.

## Prerequisites

**This script requires you to have a Dropbox App 'access token'.** You do this by making an 'app' on your Dropbox account and then generating an OAuth token for that app.

This tutorial shows you how to obtain one: http://99rabbits.com/get-dropbox-access-token/. Make sure you select the `Full Dropbox` option in the access section.

Otherwise the requirements installed from the main repo will cover all the python needs.

You also need to know the shared Dropbox URL of the Pilot survey and the password.

## Usage
```
usage: get_vast_pilot_dbx.py [-h] [--output OUTPUT] [--available-epochs]
                             [--available-files] [--download-epoch DOWNLOAD_EPOCH]
                             [--files-list FILES_LIST] [--overwrite] [--debug]
                             [--dropbox-config DROPBOX_CONFIG]
                             [--write-template-dropbox-config] [--include-legacy]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --output OUTPUT       Name of the local output directory where files will be saved
                        (default: vast_dropbox)
  --available-epochs    Print out what Epochs are available. (default: False)
  --available-files     Print out a list of available files on the shared folder.
                        (default: False)
  --download-epoch DOWNLOAD_EPOCH
                        Select to download an entire Epoch directory. Enter as an
                        integer. (default: 0)
  --files-list FILES_LIST
                        Input of files to fetch. (default: None)
  --overwrite           Overwrite any files that already exist in the output
                        directory. (default: False)
  --debug               Set logging level to debug. (default: False)
  --dropbox-config DROPBOX_CONFIG
                        Dropbox config file to be read in containing the shared url,
                        password and access token. A template can be generated using
                        '--write-template-dropbox-config'. (default: dropbox.cfg)
  --write-template-dropbox-config
                        Create a template dropbox config file. (default: False)
  --include-legacy      Include the 'LEGACY' directory when searching through files.
                        Only valid when using the '--available-files' option.
                        (default: False)
```

To run the script needs a Dropbox configuration file, which by default is assumed to be named 'dropbox.cfg'. Create a text file in the following format and enter the respective values:
```
[dropbox]
shared_url = ENTER_URL
password = ENTER_PASSWORD
access_token = ENTER_ACCESS_TOKEN
```
There is no need to put quotes around the strings. A template can be generated by using:
```
get_vast_pilot_dbx.py --write-template-dropbox-config
```
Use the option `--dropbox-config` if your config file is named something different than the default.

A log file will be saved for every run of the script.

### Modes

There are 4 different ways the script can be used:

1. `--available-epochs` will only display the currently released epochs. Nothing will be downloaded.
2. `--available-files` will generate a complete list of all the files avaialble. This is helpful in order to build your own list of files you wish to fetch. Nothing will be downloaded.
3. `--download-epoch` will download an entire Epoch directory of your choosing.
4. `--files-list` defines a text file that contains the files you wish to download. Help on this is below.

Modes 3 and 4 will all place results in an output directory. The name of the directory can be set with `--output`.

Take note of the **overwrite** option. By default this is set to `False` such that it will skip files already present in the output directory. Using this option will download all files and overwrite any exisiting files if they are already present.

#### User Files List
When supplying a list of files it needs to follow the directory structure of the Dropbox. It also needs to explictly state the files - i.e. you **cannot use wildcards** (sorry it's the limitations of using Dropbox this way).

For example if I wanted to download a set of STOKES I COMBINED images from EPOCH01, the file would be:
```
/EPOCH01/COMBINED/STOKESI_IMAGES/VAST_0918+00A.EPOCH01.I.fits
/EPOCH01/COMBINED/STOKESI_IMAGES/VAST_1739-25A.EPOCH01.I.fits
/EPOCH01/COMBINED/STOKESI_IMAGES/VAST_1753-18A.EPOCH01.I.fits
/EPOCH01/COMBINED/STOKESI_IMAGES/VAST_0943+00A.EPOCH01.I.fits
/EPOCH01/COMBINED/STOKESI_IMAGES/VAST_0216+00A.EPOCH01.I.fits
/EPOCH01/COMBINED/STOKESI_IMAGES/VAST_2143-06A.EPOCH01.I.fits
/EPOCH01/COMBINED/STOKESI_IMAGES/VAST_2208-06A.EPOCH01.I.fits

```
Note the leading `/` which is also needed.

I recommened you run `get_vast_pilot_dbx.py --available-files` and use this output to build your request.

**LEGACY DIRECTORY**: The Dropbox directory also includes the `LEGACY` folder which contains old verisons of Epoch releases that are no longer considered as part of the official release. To include this directory in the results of available files use the `--include-legacy` option.

### Examples

#### Obtaining a List of all available files
```
get_vast_pilot_dbx.py --available-files
```
This will generate a text file containing a list of available files. It will be named with a timestamp.

#### Downloading an entire epoch
Using epoch 01 as an example:
```
get_vast_pilot_dbx.py --download-epoch 1 --output VAST_DOWNLOAD
```
This will place the EPOCH01 directory in `VAST_DOWNLOAD`.

#### Downloading a user selected set of files

1. Create the text file containing the files, e.g. `to_download.txt`:
```
/EPOCH01/COMBINED/STOKESI_IMAGES/VAST_0918+00A.EPOCH01.I.fits
/EPOCH01/COMBINED/STOKESI_IMAGES/VAST_1739-25A.EPOCH01.I.fits
/EPOCH01/COMBINED/STOKESI_IMAGES/VAST_1753-18A.EPOCH01.I.fits
/EPOCH01/COMBINED/STOKESI_IMAGES/VAST_0943+00A.EPOCH01.I.fits
/EPOCH01/COMBINED/STOKESI_IMAGES/VAST_0216+00A.EPOCH01.I.fits
/EPOCH01/COMBINED/STOKESI_IMAGES/VAST_2143-06A.EPOCH01.I.fits
/EPOCH01/COMBINED/STOKESI_IMAGES/VAST_2208-06A.EPOCH01.I.fits

```
2. Then run with:
```
get_vast_pilot_dbx.py --files-list to_download.txt --output VAST_DOWNLOAD
```
This will place these files in `VAST_DOWNLOAD`. The directory structure will be mimiced.
